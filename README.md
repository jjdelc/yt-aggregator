# Youtube RSS feed aggregator

Creating this in the case the COPPA affects my personal YT recommendations and I want to keep up with the Transformers reviewers.

This generates an HTML collecting all their Videos, so I don't miss any.

To run:

    python3 planet.py index.html

Will generate `index.html` with all the videos
